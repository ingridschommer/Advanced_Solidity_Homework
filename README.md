# Advanced Solidity Homework

This project created an ERC20 token that is minted through a Crowdsale contract that is leveraged from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

This crowdsale contract manages the entire process, allowing users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin).
This contract mints the tokens automatically and distributes them to buyers in one transaction.

The contract inherits Crowdsale, CappedCrowdsale, TimedCrowdsale, RefundableCrowdsale, and MintedCrowdsale.
