# Advanced Solidity Homework

This project created an ERC20 token that is minted through a Crowdsale contract that is leveraged from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

This crowdsale contract manages the entire process, allowing users to send ETH and get back PUP (PupperCoin).
This contract mints the tokens automatically and distributes them to buyers in one transaction.

The contract inherits Crowdsale, CappedCrowdsale, TimedCrowdsale, RefundableCrowdsale, and MintedCrowdsale.

Once I deployed this contract, I added the PUP coin to MyCryto.

And sent ETH to the crowdsale from another account.

I can now see my token available in my MetaMask:
